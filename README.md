# Msc-project
AI-Enhanced UAV IDS (LightGBM + LIME)  A clean, reproducible implementation of a multi-class, explainable Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for UAV networks. The project trains LightGBM models on UAV-NIDD cases and ships a near-realtime monitoring web app (Gradio) with per-class thresholds, threat-intel context (CVE / MITRE), and LIME explanations.
